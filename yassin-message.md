Hey Muhammad (aka Luton's finest),

It saddens me that I won't able to introduce you in a meeting with the infamous words of the Stacey Dooley Bury Park Luton scene.

But honestly it was an absolute pleasure to get to know you and work with you.

You are a really driven and hard-working person who I am confident will go very far in your tech career journey.

All the best in your next role and I look forward to keeping in touch with you.

Croydon's finest,

Yassin
